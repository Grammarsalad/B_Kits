# Overview 

<br>
The purpose of this mod is to re-balance kits and base classes ala Kit Revisions.  This mod (is) will be compatible with Kit Revisions if the latter is installed first.  This mod will also offer a number of additional (optional) kits to install.  

1. Revision of base kits for Baldur's Gate games.  The mod will offer both a 'conservative' revision, and a 'radical' revision.  The latter version will alter the base structure of the classes and kits more radically and will thus be more likely to see compatibility issues with other mods.  That said, the goal of all components is to maintain compatibility with all other mods where possible.   
2. New Kits.  There will be more 'radical' versions of new kits--only available where 'radical' revisions are installed--as well as more 'conservative' new kits that should be at home in either the (conservatively) revised structure, or in an un-revised environment.  

**Compatibility**: Should be completely compatible with Kit Revisions, Proficiencies, Tome and Blood, Faiths and Powers, Might and Guile, and Rogue Rebalancing.  Additionally, this mod will strive to be compatible with all other mods.  Please notify the author (Grammarsalad) if you find an incompatibility.  

**Install Order**

TBD 

> #### Engine and Mod Compatibility: 
> ##### Install Proficiencies *either* before or after the following mods:   
> - Faiths and Powers    
> - Spells and Magic
> - 

> ##### Spells and Magic should be installed *after* the following mods to minimize conflicts:  
> - Spell Revisions (v4 beta or later) (?)
> - IWDification (?) 
> - More Style for Mages (?) 
> - Tome and Blood (?)  
> - Deities of Faerûn (?) 

> ##### Spells and Magic should be installed *before* the following mods:

# Class Revisions
Class revisions alter existing classes in some manner, as opposed to adding kits or interchangeable class features.  Class features themselves are divided into 'Conservative' and 'Radical' versions of a given class/kit structure. This mod tries, as much as possible, to allow players to mix and match conservative and radical versions together.  So, for example, a player could install conservative fighter revisions with radical bard revisions.  However, players should be warned that there might be balance issues, especially when the various class features are added to the mix.  We cannot account for everything.  That said, we will try to note where balance issues might exist, both here and in individual class sections below.

## 101-???: The Bard

**Description**

Also see the Performance Fatigue component in the 'extra' class modifications.  That component was originally meant to be a part of all Bard revisions, but I decided to separate it out as that might be too extreme of a change for some.  

### 101: The Bard: Conservative Version

This component will install the 'conservative' bard revision.  The overall changes to the Bard class are as follows (see the revised descriptions below for more detail): 

- Bards can be of any alignment

- Bards *can* cast spells while wearing up to and including chainmail without penalty.

- All races will be able to select the Bard class, though not all races will have access to every kit.  

- Bard Songs will be more useful in that they will last a number of rounds after the bard has stopped performing.  However, the bard will not be able to use the performance at will as before.  Rather, they will have a 'cool down' period, where they cannot use their song at all (alternatively, performance will cost fatigue...)  

- Most bards will have access to multiple performances. The base bard will have access to the rally, countersong, and fascinate performances.  See individual descriptions for details.

- Thief Skills: Bards will have access to more Thief Skills (Requires EEEx).  

- All bards can specialize (++) in any fighting style, and gain mastery (+++) in two weapon fighting.  

- Generally increased Hit Die.  See individual descriptions for details.

## Bard Base Class (Revised Base Class)

BARD: The Bard is a rogue, but <PRO_HESHE> is very different from the Thief. The Bard's strength is <PRO_HISHER> pleasant and charming personality. With it and <PRO_HISHER> wits, <PRO_HESHE> makes <PRO_HISHER> way through the world. A Bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore; <PRO_HESHE> learns a little bit about everything that crosses <PRO_HISHER> path and is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many Bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.
</div>

### Class Features:
- Rolls d8 for hit points.
- Lore increases by 10 per level.
- May not wear armor heavier than chain mail and may not equip shields larger than bucklers. (Spells *can* be cast while wearing armor.)
- Can achieve proficiency (+) in any weapon proficiency.
- Can achieve specialization (++) in any fighting style, except two-weapon fighting, where <PRO_HESHE> can achieve mastery (+++).
- Thieving abilities: Pick Pockets and Pick Locks (if EEEx is installed). 
- May use <PRO_HISHER>  Performance ability to play any perform ability from <PRO_HISHER> repertoire.  At 1st level, <PRO_HESHE> can rally <PRO_HISHER> allies.  At 4th level, <PRO_HESHE> can play a countersong.  At 8th level, <PRO_HESHE> can fascinate opponents.  These songs become more powerful as <PRO_HESH> gains levels as described below. All effects generally last for as long as the bard performs, + 1 round per 5 levels after finishing.  
  Performances are taxing, incresing the fatigue level of the bard by 1 for every round <PRO_HESHE> plays.  <PRO_HESHE> recovers this fatigue after 1 hour.  <PRO_HESHE> cannot perform if <PRO_HESHE> becomes exhausted.
  
**RALLY**: When the bard uses rally, <PRO_HESHE> grants all of <PRO_HISHER> allies, including <PRO_HIMHER>self, a +1 bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. At 6th level, all allies are also protected from fear.  They gain immunity to fear effects for as long as the song lasts, and any fear effects currently on them are removed.  At 12th level, all allies also gain +1 to luck, which grants an additional +1 to all saves, and a +10% bonus to all of their thieving skills.  In addition, the bonuses to attacks, damage and saves increase to +2 (for a total of +3 to saves).  Finally, at 17th level, the the bonuses to luck increases to +2, with it the additional save bonus increases to +2, and the skill bonuses increase to +20%, and the bonuses to hit, damage and saves increase to +3 (+5 to saves).  
In order to perform rally, the bard must remain in place.  If <PRO_HESHE> moves, rally ends (though, the effects continue based on <PRO_HISHER> level; that is, 1 round per 5 levels.)  
  
**COUNTERSONG**: When the bard uses this ability, all of <PRO_HISHER> allies within 30', including <PRO_HIMHER>self are protected from magic, and gain a +3 bonus to save against spells, and a +1 to all other saves.  In addition, all allies are permitted to make a save vs. spell (with the bonus), and if they succeed, they shrug off the effects of spells such as Silence, Shout, Great Shout, Command, Greater Command, or any other sound-based attack.  At 9th level, allies can also shrug off paralysis, hold, stun, charm, or emotion-based effects, such as fear or berserk, if they make their saves.  At 11th level, enemy casters find countersong distracting, and suffer a 15% chance of spell failure while within 30' of the bard.  This chance increases to 30% at 16th level.  Finally, at 18th level, all allies gain a +5 to their saves vs. spell, and +2 to their other saves.
The bard's movement is reduced by half while performing countersong.

**FASCINATE**: When the bard uses this ability, all enemies within 30 ft. must save vs. Spell (with a +2 bonus) or become enthralled, unable to take action until 1 round passes or they take damage. Enemies suffer a -1 penalty to this save for every 3 levels the bard possesses beyond 8th level (maximum -4 at 20th level).  
The bard must remain still while performing fascinate. If <PRO_HESHE> moves, the effect ends.

## Blade Kit

BLADE: The Blade is an expert fighter and adventurer whose bardic acting abilities make <PRO_HIMHER> appear more intimidating and fearsome than <PRO_HESHE> is. This Bard's fighting style is flashy and entertaining but is also lethally dangerous.
</div>


### Advantages:
- At 1st level, may use the Offensive Spin and Defensive Spin stances. A character can only enter a single stance at a time, but they are not limited in terms of the number of times per day that they can enter a stance. The blade exits either offensive spin or defensive spin if <PRO_HESHE> is struck in combat and <PRO_HESHE> cannot enter another stance for an additional 3 rounds after being struck.
- Performs Weapon Display as <PRO_HISHER> bard song.
- Gains Mastery (+++) in two-weapon fighting at first level.  
- The Blade can specialize (++) in any melee weapon.
- 1 fewer spell slot per spell level.  As a result, <PRO_HESHE> doesn't cast any spells until 3rd level.  

**DEFENSIVE SPIN**: Defensive spin is a specialized form of parrying that is quite impressive to watch.  While performing defensive spin, the Blade gains a +1 bonus to AC against all melee weapons for every two levels <PRO_HESHE> has (minimum +1) to a maximum of +10 at level 20.  Further, any opponent that gets in melee range (4') with the blade must save vs. breath or suffer 1d6 points of slashing damage from the whirling blades.  This damage increases by 1d6 every 5 levels (max 5d6 at 20th level).  The Blade cannot attack nor cast spells while using Defensive Spin.

**OFFENSIVE SPIN**: Offensive spin is a much more aggressive display of prowess compared to defensive spin, though it is a bit more reckless.  While in this stance, the Blade's movement rate doubles and <PRO_HESHE> gains a +2 bonus to melee attack and damage rolls as well as an extra attack per round. Finally,<PRO_HESHE> deals an additional +1 to damage with all melee attacks for every 5 levels. Offensive Spin may not be used in conjunction with the Haste or Improved Haste spells. The blade suffers a -2 penalty to AC while using offensive spin.  

**WEAPON DISPLAY**: When performing a weapon display, the Blade performs an impressive and intimidating display with <PRO_HISHER> weapon.  All intelligent enemies within 30' of the Blade must make a save vs. wands or be demoralized, suffering a -2 penalty to attack rolls, AC and moral.  This penalty increases by -1 for each five levels <PRO_HESHE> possesses (max -6 at 20th level). Enemies make their save at -1 per 6 levels of the Blade (maximum -3 at 18th level).
Additionally, the display inspires allies, granting them a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.

Enemies that come within melee range of the blade (about 4') must save vs. breath (with a -2 penalty) or take 1d6 slashing damage from the whirling blades. This damage increases by 1d6 for each 5 levels (max 5d6 at 20th level).

The blade can only move at half speed while performing Weapon Display.

Finally, Weapon Display cannot be performed while the blade is in a Stance.
```
```



### Disadvantages:

- Only gains 5 lore per level.
- The Blade cannot perform Rally, Countersong, or Fascinate.

<div class='wide'>
## Jester Kit

JESTER: This Bard is well versed in the arts of ridicule and hilarity, and uses <PRO_HISHER> abilities to distract and confuse <PRO_HISHER> enemies, cavorting madly during combat. Do not mistake <PRO_HIMHER> for a true fool, however, as <PRO_HESHE> can also be quite deadly.
</div>

### Advantages:
- Starting at 1st level, <PRO_HESHE> can use Taunt one time per day.  <PRO_HESHE> gains one additional use of Taunt every 4 levels.  
- At 1st level, <PRO_HISHER> may use <PRO_HISHER> Performance ability to both cheer up <PRO_HISHER> allies and distract and enrage <PRO_HISHER> foes with Bafoonery/Taunting.  This performance becomes more powerful as <PRO_HESH> gains levels as described below.  At 8th level, <PRO_HESHE> gains Fascinate.
- Wily: The Jester gains a +2 bonus to AC and saves vs. enchantments.  Additionally, the jester is immune to confusion, chaos and any other similar spells.

**TAUNT**: The jester can use taunt against any creature within 30' that can hear <PRO_HIMHER> and that has greater than animal intelligence.  If the creature fails a save vs. spell, they become enraged and resort to melee, disregarding all tactics, possibly even mistakenly attacking their own allies in a fit of rage.    

This effect lasts for 1 round, +1 round per 3 levels of the jester.  Further, the target suffers a penalty to their save for every three levels of the jester.

The jester cannot taunt a creature more than once in a given encounter.  Whether or not they save, targets are immune to further taunting effects for 8 hours.

**BUFFOONERY/JESTING**: The jester is a master at using humor and buffoonery to lighten the mood, buffering <PRO_HISHER> allies against harmful magics and effects, often by telling timely jokes at the expense of <PRO_HISHER> enemies.

While using this performance, the Jester takes advantage of distracted enemies effectively gaining a +2 bonus to AC.  This bonus increases by +1 per 5 levels the jester has attained (maximum +6 at 20th level). 

At 1st level, allies gain a +1 bonus to saves, while enemies must save each round vs. wands with a +2 bonus or become enraged (as taunt above) for 1 round.  Every 5 levels the jester has attained, the save bonus increases by +1 and enemies suffer a -1 penalty to this save (max +5/-5 at 20th level).  

At 10th level, allies recover from , and are immune to, fear and charm effects while the jester is performing.  <PRO_HISHER> enemies must make a save vs. paralysis each round (in addition to the save vs. enrage) or become confused for 1 round.  Enemies gain a -1 penalty to this save at levels 15 and 20.

### Disadvantages:
- The Jester cannot perform Rally or Countersong.
- The Jester only gains d6 hit points per level.

## Skald Kit (TO BE CONTINUED)

SKALD: This nordic Bard is also a warrior of great strength, skill, and virtue; <PRO_HISHER> songs are inspiring sagas of battle and valor, and the Skald devotes <PRO_HISHER> life to those pursuits.
</div>

### Advantages:
- Rolls d10 for hit points.
- At 1st level, <PRO_HESHE> gains a +1 to melee attack rolls.  <PRO_HESHE> gains an additional +1 bonus to melee attack rolls every 4 levels (maximum +6 to attack at 20th level).  
- At 1st level, <PRO_HESHE> gains Inspiring Blow whenever <PRO_HESHE> uses <PRO_HISHER> Performance Ability.  Whenever <PRO_HESHE> lands a blow in melee combat, <PRO_HESHE> extends the effects of <PRO_HISHER> Performance for one additional round.  
- May use <PRO_HISHER> Performance ability to play any song from <PRO_HISHER> repertoire.  At 1st level, <PRO_HESHE> can chant a battlesong to inspire <PRO_HISHER> allies.  At 6th level, <PRO_HESHE> can Incite Rage in <PRO_HISHER> allies.  Finally, at 12th level, <PRO_HESHE> can sing Song of the Fallen.  These songs become more powerful as <PRO_HESH> gains levels as described below.
The Skald's songs last for as long as <PRO_HESHE> continues to perform, plus 1 round thereafter.  Each time <PRO_HESHE> lands a blow in melee combat, the effects of <PRO_HISHER> performance extend for one additional round (this ability can only extend a performance by 1 round in a given round.  That is, if <PRO_HESHE> hits an opponent more than one time in melee combat in a given round, <PRO_HESHE> can only extend the duration of <PRO_HISHER> performance by a single round.  
- At 7th level, <PRO_HESHE> gains +1/2 attack per round.  
- At 14th level, <PRO_HESHE> this bonus increases to +1 attack per round. 

**BATTLESONG**: ?  
 1st level: Grants allies a +2 bonus to hit and damage rolls, and a +2 bonus to AC.
 15th level: Grants allies a +4 bonus to hit and damage rolls, a +4 bonus to AC, and immunity to fear.
 20th level: Grants allies a +4 bonus to hit and damage rolls, a +4 bonus to AC, and immunity to fear, stun, and confusion. 

**INCITE RAGE**: 

**SONG OF THE FALLEN**:

### Disadvantages:
- The Skald casts -2 spells per spell level.  That is, <PRO_HESHE> begins casting spells at 3rd level.  
- The Skald cannot perform Rally, Countersong or Fascinate.  
- The Skald does not make use of any thief skills.

## 201-???: The Cleric

**Description**

Also see the Turn Bonus by Charisma, Spontaneous Casting, Cleric Weapon Training and Cleric Armor Training components in the 'extra' class modifications.  Note that if users install spontaneous casting and any cleric revision, it is recommended that they select the option to Replace Domain spells with Spontaneous casting for balance reasons unless they also install Cleric Armor Training.  

### 201: The Cleric: Conservative Version

This component will install the 'conservative' cleric revision.  The overall changes to the Cleric class are minimal, as the cleric is a pretty good class as it is.  However, there are a number of optional 'extra' classes that the user is invited to check out (See below).  The Conservative changes are as follows (see the revised descriptions below for more detail): 

- The introduction of Domain Spells (And/or spontaneous casting) to increase versatility of the cleric.  

- All clerics can specialize (++) in any fighting style except two weapon fighting.  

- New Spells.  The cleric, for the most part, is defined by their spells. As such, one way to improve the class is to give them better spells.

</div>




\page

<div class='wide'>
## The Cleric (Revised Base Class) (TO BE CONTINUED)

CLERIC: The Cleric is an adventuring priest who does not exclusively worship a single deity, but venerates the pantheon as a whole, .  <PRO_HESHE> understands that no single deity can or should represent every important aspect of life.  Rather, each deity has their place, their portfolios contributing to a whole that is greater than any single part.  As such, these clerics are particularly versatile as they can petition different deities for spells on different occasions, though they lack the power that only a specialist can wield.  
</div>


### Class Features:
- May wear helmets.
- May wear any armor.
- Domain Spells^: Each day, a cleric can select one sphere from which <PRO_HESHE> can draw spells from.  The selected sphere need not be one that the cleric normally has access to.  Once selected, <PRO_HESHE> will be able to cast a single spell each level <PRO_HESHE> can cast of the relevant level from that domain per day.  In any given day, if <PRO_HESHE> casts a domain spell before selecting a domain, <PRO_HESHE> will have to wait for the next day select a new domain.
– May only use non-bladed, non-piercing weapons (war hammer, club, flail, mace, quarterstaff, sling).
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in any weapon class.
– May only become Proficient (one slot) in two weapon fighting.
– May Specialize (two slots) in any fighting style except two weapon fighting.
– May Turn Undead.
– May cast priest spells.
– Hit Die: d8

Prime Requisites For Dual-Classing: Wisdom

^Domain spells can be swapped out for Spontaneous Casting (See below).

**Domain Spells**

Here is a list of each spell that the cleric can cast once per day for each selected sphere.  Note that in some instances, a character will gain the ability to cast a single spell more than once.  Also note that in some instances, different spells will be available depending on cleric alignment.  

**HEALING**

| Spell Level | Spell |
| :---: | :---: | 
| 1st | Cure Light Wounds |
| 2nd | Cure Moderate Wounds* |
| 3rd | Cure Medium Wounds |
| 4th | Cure Serious Wounds |
| 5th | Mass Cure Light Wounds |
| 6th | Heal |
| 7th | Heal (x2) |

//*spell added by this component

## 501-???: The Fighter (TO BE CONTINUED)

**Description**

Also see the Performance Fatigue component in the 'extra' class modifications.  That component was originally meant to be a part of all Fighter revisions, at least Barbarian and Berserker Revisions, but I decided to separate it out as that might be too extreme of a change for some.  

### 501: The Fighter: Conservative Version

This component will install the 'conservative' fighter revision.  The overall changes to the Fighter class are as follows (see the revised descriptions below for more detail): 

- Fighting Stances: Fighters will be able to employ fighting stances to change up their attack strategies.  Stances are mutually exclusive abilities that enhance combat ability in some way, but often at the expense of other combat abilities.  See individual Stance descriptions.  All fighters and fighter kits will have some access to some kits, though the base fighter will have a larger diversity of stances to choose from.  

- Weapon Versatility: Base fighters will be able to use many different kinds of weapons competently.

**Working Notes**

Class Features:
- Rolls d10 for hit points.
- Can achieve grandmastery (+++++) in any weapon proficiency.
- Can use all types of armor.
- Stance: REVISE DESCRIPTION
- Weapon Versatility: Beginning at 5th level, the fighter gains one proficiency in all weapon types (+).  At 15th level, <PRO_HESHE> gains an additional proficiency point (+) in all weapon types.  Note that this cannot bring any weapon above Grandmastery (+++++).   

**STANCE DESCRIPTIONS REVISE**  

***Compatibility Notes***:  
**B_Proficiencies**: Weapon Versatility Applies to All Weapon Proficiencies as well as Armor and Miscellaneous proficiency.  (Obviously, will not apply to non-weapon proficiencies.)

# Class 'Extras'

## Known Issues (Class 'Extras'): 

- **Thief Skills: Read Scrolls**: Read Scrolls will not display for a character created in Throne of Bhaal.  The skill will display upon level up, however.  

</div>

\page
<div class='wide'>
### 1201-1207: Class 'Extras': Performance Fatigue
 
If this tweak is installed, either the Bard Song or the Shaman Dance or both cause 1 point of fatigue for each round the character performs. Fatigue caused by performing recovers after 1 turn.

If installed for other class abilities, fatigue will only accrue by 1 point per use.  Typically, this fatigue lasts until the character rests as normal.  

When the character reaches 7 points of fatigue, they gain the 'fatigued' condition.    

This component is meant to coincide with the revisions to the various classes presented in this mod as a kind of balance, but I decided to separate it out as that might be too extreme of a change for some. 
</div>

#### 1201: Performance Fatigue: Bard Song Fatigue

This component only adds performance fatigue to the Bard Song and _not_ to the Shaman Dance. 

#### 1202: Shaman Dance Performance Fatigue

This component only adds performance fatigue to the Shaman Dance and _not_ to the Bard Song. 

#### 1203: Bard Song and Shaman Dance Performance Fatigue

This component  adds performance fatigue to both the Shaman Dance and the Bard Song. 

#### 1204: Berserker Enrage Fatigue

This component imposes 1 point of fatigue whenever the Enrage Class feature is used.   

#### 1205: Barbarian Rage Fatigue

This component imposes 1 point of fatigue whenever the Rage Class feature is used.

#### 1206: Barbarian Rage and Berserker Enrage Fatigue

This component imposes 1 point of fatigue whenever the Rage or Enrage Class feature is used.

#### 1207: Everybody gets fatigued

This component imposes 1 point of fatigue whenever the Rage or Enrage Class feature is used.

This component  adds performance fatigue to both the Shaman Dance and the Bard Song.

### 1601-1603: Class 'Extras': New Class Skills
This group of components adds (thief-like) class skills to the game or modifies class skills to allow other classes to perform them where possible.  
</div>

#### 1601: All New Skills (Requires EEex) 
This component installs both the new bard skills and new thief skills (see below for descriptions).  


#### 1602: Only Bard Skills (requires EEX)
This component adds bard specific skills to the game--Bardic Knowledge and Performance--and enables the bard to pick locks.  This component also allows the bard to assign points into their skills, as a thief.  The Bard and Jester get 25 points at first level and 15 points per additional level.  The Blade gets 15 points at first level, and 10 points per level.  The Skald gets 10 points at level 1 and 5 points per level.  See the next section for skill descriptions.  These new thief skills gain a bonus as per Variant Attribute bonuses to skills described in the next section.  

#### 1603: Only New Thief Skills (requires EEX)
This component adds thief specific skills to the game--use scroll and WHAT???--and allows the thief to select those skills as normal.  See the next section for skill descriptions. These new thief skills gain a bonus as per Variant Attribute bonuses to skills described in the next section.

### 1701: Class 'Extras': Everybody Can Search (requires EEX)
This component gives all characters a chance, if small, to search for traps (if not disable them). Every class gets a base 5% chance to detect traps (modified by dexterity--or otherwise--as normal).

#### 1801: Class 'Extras': Only Variant Attribute bonuses to skills
This component makes a few changes to the standard thief skills such that rogues gain bonuses (and penalties) to these skills based off of attributes other than dexterity.  See the next section for details.

## 'Extra' Descriptions
This section describes the 'extra' features in more detail.




### Variant Attribute bonuses to skills
Why should dexterity help a thief detect illusions or traps?  Why wouldn't a high intelligence help a thief figure out how to read a scroll? This table describes both the changes to the base thief skills (e.g. component 1604) and the added skills (e.g. component 1602). Any skill not found in this table is unchanged (i.e. they gain dex bonuses as found in skilldex.2da).

# New Kits
Class revisions alter existing classes in some manner, as opposed to adding kits or interchangeable class features.  Class features themselves are divided into 'Conservative' and 'Radical' versions of a given class/kit structure. This mod tries, as much as possible, to allow players to mix and match conservative and radical versions together.  So, for example, a player could install conservative fighter revisions with radical bard revisions.  However, players should be warned that there might be balance issues, especially when the various class features are added to the mix.  We cannot account for everything.  That said, we will try to note where balance issues might exist, both here and in individual class sections below.

# Magic Item Creation and Additional Magic Items

**Note**: The added items are identical to those added by Spells and Magic and B_Kits. However, consumable magic items--in particular scrolls and wands--work slightly differently in these three mods.  These mods are completely compatible, however, and any changes will be noted in the description.    

This component adds new magic items, and item creation.
