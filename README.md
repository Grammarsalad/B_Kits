# B_Kits

The purpose of this mod is to rebalance kits and base classes ala Kit Revisions.  This mod (is) will be compatible with Kit Revisions if the latter is installed first.  This mod will also offer a number of additional (optional) kits to install.  

1. Revision of base kits for Baldur's Gate games.  The mod will offer both a 'conservative' revision, and a 'radical' revision.  The latter version will alter the base structure of the classes and kits more radically and will thus be more likely to see compatibility issues with other mods.  That said, the goal of all components is to maintain compatibility with all other mods where possible.   
2. New Kits.  There will be more 'radical' versions of new kits--only available where 'radical' revisions are installed--as well as more 'conservative' new kits that should be at home in either the (conservatively) revised structure, or in an unrevised environment.  

**Compatibility**: Should be completely compatible with Kit Revisions, Proficiencies, Tome and Blood, Faiths and Powers, Might and Guile, and Rogue Rebalancing.  Additionally, this mod will strive to be compatible with all other mods.  Please notify the author (Grammarsalad) if you find an incompatibility.  

**Install Order**

TBD

## Component Overview

GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF EACH COMPONENT HERE.  Describe them more fully below

### 101: Bard: Conservative

This component will install the 'conservative' bard revision.  The overall changes to the Bard class are as follows (see the revised descriptions below for more detail): 

- Bards can be of any alignment

- Bards *can* cast spells while wearing up to and including chainmail without penalty.

- All races will be able to select the Bard class, though not all races will have access to every kit.  

- Bard Songs will be more useful in that they will last a number of rounds after the bard has stopped performing.  However, the bard will not be able to use the performance at will as before.  Rather, they will have a 'cool down' period, where they cannot use their song at all (alternatively, performance will cost fatigue...)  

- Most bards will have access to multiple performances. The base bard will have access to the rally, countersong, and fascinate performances.  See individual descriptions for details.

- Thief Skills: Bards will have access to more Thief Skills (Requires EEEx).  

- All bards can specialize (++) in any fighting style, and gain mastery (+++) in two weapon fighting.  

- Generally increased Hit Die.  See individual descriptions for details.

### Bard Base Class

BARD: The Bard is a rogue, but <PRO_HESHE> is very different from the Thief. The Bard's strength is <PRO_HISHER> pleasant and charming personality. With it and <PRO_HISHER> wits, <PRO_HESHE> makes <PRO_HISHER> way through the world. A Bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore; <PRO_HESHE> learns a little bit about everything that crosses <PRO_HISHER> path and is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many Bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

Class Features:
- Rolls d8 for hit points.
- Lore increases by 10 per level.
- May not wear armor heavier than chain mail and may not equip shields larger than bucklers. (Spells *can* be cast while wearing armor.)
- Can achieve proficiency (+) in any weapon proficiency.
- Can achieve specialization (++) in any fighting style, except two-weapon fighting, where <PRO_HESHE> can achieve mastery (+++).
- Thieving abilities: Pick Pockets and Pick Locks (if EEEx is installed). 
- May use <PRO_HISHER>  Performance ability to play any perform ability from <PRO_HISHER> repertoire.  At 1st level, <PRO_HESHE> can rally <PRO_HISHER> allies.  At 4th level, <PRO_HESHE> can play a countersong.  At 8th level, <PRO_HESHE> can fascinate <PRO_HISHER> enemies.  These songs become more powerful as <PRO_HESH> gains levels as described below.  
All effects generally last for as long as the bard plays the tune, + 1 round per 5 levels after finishing.  After performing, a bard song, the <PRO_HESHE> loses the ability to perform again for 2 hours.  This time is reduced to 1 hour at level 10 and is reduced to 3 turns at 15th level. Finally, at 20th level, the cooldown period is reduced to 1 turn.

RALLY: When the bard uses rally, <PRO_HESHE> grants all of <PRO_HISHER> allies, including <PRO_HIMHER>self, a +1 bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and saving throws. At 6th level, all allies are also protected from fear.  They gain immunity to fear effects for as long as the song lasts, and any fear effects currently on them are removed.  At 12th level, all allies also gain +1 to luck, which grants an additional +1 to all saves, and a +10% bonus to all of their thieving skills.  In addition, the bonuses to attacks, damage and saves increase to +2 (for a total of +3 to saves).  Finally, at 17th level, the the bonuses to luck increases to +2, with it the additional save bonus increases to +2, and the skill bonuses increas to +20%, and the bonuses to hit, damage and saves increase to +3 (+5 to saves).  
In order to perform rally, the bard must remain in place.  If <PRO_HESHE> moves, rally ends (though, the effects continue based on <PRO_HISHER> level; that is, 1 round per 5 levels.)

COUNTERSONG: When the bard uses this ability, all of <PRO_HISHER> allies within 30', including <PRO_HIMHER>self are protected from magic, and gain a +3 bonus to save against spells, and a +1 to all other saves.  In addition, all allies are permitted to make a save vs. spell (with the bonus), and if they succeed, they shrug off the effects of spells such as Silence, Shout, Great Shout, Command, Greater Command, or any other sound-based attack.  At 9th level, allies can also shrug off paralysis, hold, stun, charm, or emotion-based effects, such as fear or berserk, if they make their saves.  At 11th level, enemy casters find countersong distracting, and suffer a 30% chance of spell failure while within 30' of the bard.  This chance increases to 50% at 16th level.  Finally, at 18th level, all allies gain a +4 to their saves vs. spell, and +2 to their other saves.

While performing a countersong, <PRO_HESHE> can only move at half speed.

FASCINATE: When the bard uses this ability, all enemies within 30 ft. must save vs. Spell or become enthralled, unable to take action until 1 round passes or they take damage. Enemies suffer a -1 penalty to this save for every 3 levels the bard possesses beyond 8th level (maximum -4 at 20th level).  The duration of this ability is extended by 1 round for every 4 levels the bard possesses beyond 8th level (maximum 4 rounds at 20th level).

While perfroming Fascinate, <PRO_HESHE> cannot move at all, and unlike a normal performance, the effect ends as soon as the bard moves, regardless of <PRO_HISHER> level.

### Blade Kit

BLADE: The Blade is an expert fighter and adventurer whose bardic acting abilities make <PRO_HIMHER> appear more intimidating and fearsome than <PRO_HESHE> is. This Bard's fighting style is flashy and entertaining but can also be dangerous.

Advantages:
- At 1st level, <PRO_HESHE> may use the Offensive Spin and Defensive Spin stances. A character can only enter a single stance at a time, but they are not limited in terms of the number of times per day that they can enter a stance. The Blade's stances are disrupted when <PRO_HESHE> is struck in combat.  <PRO_HESHE> exits either offensive spin or defensive spin if <PRO_HESHE> is struck in combat and <PRO_HESHE> cannot enter another stance for an additional 3 rounds after being struck.
- Performs Weapon Display as <PRO_HISHER> bard song.
- Gains Mastery (+++) in two-weapon fighting at first level.  
- At 3rd level, the Blade can specialize (++) in any single weapon. At 3rd level or anytime thereafter, <PRO_HESHE> can select any single weapon with which <PRO_HESHE> is proficient and gain specialization with that weapon.  At 9th level, or anytime thereafter, <PRO_HESHE> can specialize (++) in a second weapon <PRO_HESHE> is proficient with.

Disadvantages:

- Only gains 5 lore per level.
- The Blade cannot perform Rally, Countersong or Fascinate.
- Receives -1 spell per spell level, and so cannot begin casting spells until 3rd level.
  
DEFENSIVE SPIN: Defensive spin is a specialized form of parrying that is quite impressive to watch.  While performing defensive spin, the Blade gains a +1 bonus to AC against all melee weapons for every two levels <PRO_HESHE> has (minimum +1) to a maximum of +10 at level 20.  Further, any opponent that gets in melee range (4') with the blade has a 50% chance to suffer 1d6 points of slashing damage from the whirling blades.  This damage increases by 1d6 every 5 levels.  The Blade cannot attack nor cast spells while using Defensive Spin. If the Blade is struck in combat, <PRO_HESHE> exits Defensive Spin. 

OFFENSIVE SPIN: Offensive spin is a much more aggressive display of prowess compared to defensive spin, though it is a bit more reckless.  While in this stance, the Blade's movement rate doubles and <PRO_HESHE> gains a +2 bonus to melee attack and damage rolls as well as an extra attack per round. Finally,<PRO_HESHE> deals an additional +1 to damage with all melee attacks for every 5 levels. Offensive Spin may not be used in conjunction with the Haste or Improved Haste spells. The blade suffers a -2 penalty to AC while using offensive spin.  If the Blade is struck in combat, <PRO_HESHE> exits Offensive Spin. 

WEAPON DISPLAY: When performing a weapon display, the Blade performs an impressive and intimidating display with <PRO_HISHER> weapon.  All intelligent enemies within 30' of the Blade with fewer hit die than <PRO_HIMHER> must make a save vs. wands or be overcome by fear for the duration of the display.  Enemies that have equal or more hit die than the blade within 30' must save or be demoralized, suffering a -2 penalty to attack rolls.  Enemies make their save at -1 per 6 levels of the Blade (maximum -3 at 18th level).
Additionally, the display inspires allies, granting them a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  This bonus increases by +1 per 5 levels.

Finally, enemies that come within melee range of the blade (about 4') have a 50% chance to take 1d6 slashing damage from the whirling blades. This damage increases by 1d6 for each 5 levels.

The blade cannot move while performing the display. That is, moving ends the performance.

**Component 001: INSTALL ALL REVISED AND NEW KITS (RADICAL VERSION)**

This Component will use more 'extreme' measures to radically rework the way that kits and classes work in the game.  While kit and class selection will appear more or less the same while playing the game, this component will make a number of changes 'under the hood' to allow for things like removed opposition schools, and so on.  See the Details Below

## Component 001

**All Classes** 

Generally speaking, all classes get something of a 'boost' at first level but find that their power level does not increase as rapidly as before.  Spellcasters get more spells in the early levels but cannot cast spells of higher levels as often or as early.    

## Bard Alterations

**All Bards**

## Known Issues

- You MUST explicitly select a kit when prompted during character creation.  If you do not do so, you will end up with the old class and a likely very messed up spell list (among other things).

**Alteration Overview**:

- The three aspects of the bard class that I consider to be 'radical' are the custom spell progression, the custom spell list, and the alteration to how the bard song works (i.e. increases in potency over time, lasts for a number of rounds after the bard has stopped performing, is disabled for a period, and is generally limited in some other respect.) 

- All bards can specialize (++) in any fighting style, and gain mastery (+++) in two weapon fighting.  

- Bards will be restricted in the kinds of magic they can initially learn.  In particular, they cannot learn evocation, conjuration or necromancy spells (some kits are exceptions to this).  But, they will have an opportunity to learn special spells via 'song books' that they can find or purchase in their trails.  

- Bards can be of any alignment

- Bards *can* cast spells while wearing up to and including chainmail without penalty.

- All races will be able to select the Bard class, though not all will be able to take every kit.  

- Bard Songs will be more useful in that they will last a number of rounds after the bard has stopped singing.  However, the bard will not be able to use the song at will.  Rather, they will have a 'cool down' period, where they cannot use their song at all.  At first level, this period will last for 8 hours.  

- Bards will be able to cast spells starting at first level.  The progression is the same as before, except the bard gains access to 1st and second level spells one level eariler, and overall they cast one more first or second level spell.  Revised spell progression:

| Bard Level | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 2nd | 2 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 3rd | 3 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 4th | 3 | 2 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 5th | 4 | 2 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 6th | 4 | 3 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 7th | 4 | 3 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - |
| 8th | 4 | 4 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - |
| 9th | 4 | 4 | 2 | - | - | - | - | - |
| 10th | 4 | 4 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | - |
| 11th | 4 | 4 | 3 | 1 | - | - | - | - |
| 12th | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | - | - | - | - |
| 13th | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - |
| 14th | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | - | - | - |
| 15th | 4 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | - | - |
| 16th | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | - | - |
| 17th | 5 | 5 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | - | - |
| 18th | 5 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | - |
| 19th | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | - | - |
| 20th | 5 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | - | - |

- Bards will have their own unique spell list in a manner of speaking.

**Unique Bard Spells**

**Soothing Melody**
Eliminates and protects from many mental effects, and gives bonus hit points.
