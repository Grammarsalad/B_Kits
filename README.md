# B_Kits

The purpose of this mod is to rebalance kits and base classes ala Kit Revisions.  This mod (is) will be compatible with Kit Revisions if the latter is installed first.  This mod will also offer a number of additional (optional) kits to install.  

1. Revision of base kits for Baldur's Gate games.  The mod will offer both a 'conservative' revision, and a 'radical' revision.  The latter version will alter the base structure of the classes and kits more radically, and will thus be more likely to see compatibility issues with other mods.  That said, the goal of all components is to maintain compatibility with all other mods where possible.   
2. New Kits.  There will be more 'radical' versions of new kits--only available where 'radical' revisions are installed--as well as more 'conservative' new kits that should be at home in either the (conservatively) revised structure, or in an unrevised environment.  

**Compatibility**: Should be completely compatible with Kit Revisions, Proficiencies, Tome and Blood, Faiths and Powers, Might and Guile, and Rogue Rebalancing.  Additionally, this mod will strive to be compatible with all other mods.  Please notify the author (Grammarsalad) if you find an incompatibility.  

**Install Order**

TBD

## Component Overview

GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF EACH COMPONENT HERE.  Describe them more fully below

**Component 001: INSTALL ALL REVISED AND NEW KITS (RADICAL VERSION)**

This Component will use more 'extreme' measures to radically rework the way that kits and classes work in the game.  While kit and class selection will appear more or less the same while playing the game, this component will make a number of changes 'under the hood' to allow for things like unique bard spell lists, removed opposition schools, and so on.  See the Details Below

## Component 001

**All Classes** 

Generally speaking, all classes get something of a 'boost' at first level, but find that their power level does not increase as rapidly as before.  Spellcasters get more spells in the early levels, but cannot cast spells of higher levels as often or as early.  All classes begin play with more hit points than before, but find their hit point progression slowed dramatically as they level up.  

-  All classes start wtih triple (3x) their normal hit points at first level.  However, they only recieve a small number of hit points after that:
1. warriors: 3 hit points per level (4 per level for the barbarian)
2. priests and rogues: 2 hit points per level
3. mages and sorcerers: 1 hit point per level

## Bard Alterations

**All Bards**

- All bards can specialize in any fighting style, and gain mastery in two weapon fighting.  

- Bards can be of any alighment

- Bards *can* cast spells while wearing up to and including chainmail without penalty.

- Bard Songs will be more useful in that they will last a number of rounds
