# B_Kits

The purpose of this mod is to rebalance kits and base classes ala Kit Revisions.  This mod (is) will be compatible with Kit Revisions if the latter is installed first.  This mod will also offer a number of additional (optional) kits to install.  

1. Revision of base kits for Baldur's Gate games.  The mod will offer both a 'conservative' revision, and a 'radical' revision.  The latter version will alter the base structure of the classes and kits more radically and will thus be more likely to see compatibility issues with other mods.  That said, the goal of all components is to maintain compatibility with all other mods where possible.   
2. New Kits.  There will be more 'radical' versions of new kits--only available where 'radical' revisions are installed--as well as more 'conservative' new kits that should be at home in either the (conservatively) revised structure, or in an unrevised environment.  

**Compatibility**: Should be completely compatible with Kit Revisions, Proficiencies, Tome and Blood, Faiths and Powers, Might and Guile, and Rogue Rebalancing.  Additionally, this mod will strive to be compatible with all other mods.  Please notify the author (Grammarsalad) if you find an incompatibility.  

**Install Order**

TBD

## Component Overview

GIVE AN OVERVIEW OF EACH COMPONENT HERE.  Describe them more fully below

**Component 001: INSTALL ALL REVISED AND NEW KITS (RADICAL VERSION)**

This Component will use more 'extreme' measures to radically rework the way that kits and classes work in the game.  While kit and class selection will appear more or less the same while playing the game, this component will make a number of changes 'under the hood' to allow for things like removed opposition schools, and so on.  See the Details Below

## Component 001

**All Classes** 

Generally speaking, all classes get something of a 'boost' at first level but find that their power level does not increase as rapidly as before.  Spellcasters get more spells in the early levels but cannot cast spells of higher levels as often or as early.    

## Bard Alterations

**All Bards**


**Alteration Overview**:

- The two aspects of the bard class that I consider to be 'radical' are the custom spell progression, and the alteration to how the bard song works (i.e. increases in potency over time, lasts for a number of rounds after the bard has stopped performing, is disabled for a period, and is generally limited in some other respect.) 

- All bards can specialize (++) in any fighting style, and gain mastery (+++) in two weapon fighting.  

- Bards can be of any alignment

- Bards *can* cast spells while wearing up to and including chainmail without penalty.

- Bard Songs will be more useful in that they will last a number of rounds after the bard has stopped singing.  However, the bard will not be able to use the song at will.  Rather, they will have a 'cool down' period, where they cannot use their song at all.  At first level, this period will last for 8 hours.  

- Bards will be able to cast spells starting at first level.  Revised spell progression:

| Bard Level | 1st | 2nd | 3rd | 4th | 5th | 6th | 7th | 8th |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1st | 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 2nd | 2 | - | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 3rd | 3 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 4th | 3 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 5th | 4 | 2 | - | - | - | - | - | - |
| 6th | 4 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - | - | - |

| 13th | 5 | 4 | 3 | 2 | 1 | - | - | - |
| 14th | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 1 | - | - | - |
| 15th | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | - | - |
| 16th | 6 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | 1 | - | - |
| 17th | 6 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 3 | 1 | - | - |
| 18th | 6 | 5 | 4 | 3 | 3 | 2 | - | - |
| 19th | 6 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 3 | 2 | - | - |
| 20th | 6 | 5 | 4 | 4 | 4 | 3 | - | - |

- Bards will have their own unique spell list.

- All races will be able to select the Bard class, though not all will be able to take every kit.  

## Bard Kits and Base Class

### Bard Base Class

BARD: The Bard is a rogue, but <PRO_HESHE> is very different from the Thief. The Bard's strength is <PRO_HISHER> pleasant and charming personality. With it and <PRO_HISHER> wits, <PRO_HESHE> makes <PRO_HISHER> way through the world. A Bard is a talented musician and a walking storehouse of gossip, tall tales, and lore; <PRO_HESHE> learns a little bit about everything that crosses <PRO_HISHER> path and is a jack-of-all-trades but master of none. While many Bards are scoundrels, their stories and songs are welcome almost everywhere.

Class Features:
- Rolls d8 for hit points.
- Lore increases by 10 per level.
- May not wear armor heavier than chain mail and may not equip shields larger than bucklers. (Spells *can* be cast while wearing armor.)
- Can achieve proficiency (+) in any weapon proficiency.
- Can achieve specialization (++) in an fighting style, except two-weapon fighting, where <PRO_HESHE> can achieve mastery (+++).
– Thieving abilities: Pick Pockets.
– May cast arcane spells starting with one first level spell at level one.
- The Bard can figure out and use almost any magical item, including items typically restricted to other classes, such as priest scrolls.
– May use their Performance ability to play any song from <PRO_HISHER> repertoire.  At 1st level, <PRO_HESHE> can rally <PRO_HISHER> allies, or perform a Countersong.  At 8th level, <PRO_HESHE> can fascinate <PRO_HISHER> enemies.  These songs become more powerful as <PRO_HESH> gains levels as described below.
All effects last for as long as the bard plays the tune, and for 2 rounds, + 1 round per 5 levels, afterward.  After performing, a bard song, the bard loses the ability to perform again for 2 hours.  This time is reduced to 1 hour at level 7 and is reduced again to 3 turns at 14th level. Finally, at 18th level, the cooldown period is reduced to 1 turn.
While the bard is performing, <PRO_HESHE> moves at 1/2 speed.

RALLY: When the bard uses rally, <PRO_HESHE> grants all of <PRO_HISHER> allies a +1 bonus to attack rolls, damage rolls, and armor class. At 6th level, all allies also gain +1 to luck, +10 to lore, and a +10% bonus to all of their thieving skills.  Finally, at 11th level, all allies additionally +10% resistance to slashing, piercing, crushing, and missile damage, and the ability to regenerate 2 Hit Points per round.

COUNTERSONG: When the bard uses this ability, all of <PRO_HISHER> allies are protected from magic, and gain a +3 save against spells, and a +1 to all other saves. At 3rd level, all allies within 30 ft. gain immunity to fear effects for as long as the song lasts, and any fear effects currently on them are removed.  At 9th level, all allies within 30 ft. have a 50% chance to shrug off the effects of spells such as Silence, Shout, Great Shout, Command, Greater Command, or any other sound-based attack.

FASCINATE: When the bard uses this ability, all enemies within 30 ft. must save vs. Spell or become enthralled, unable to take action until 1 round passes or they take damage. Enemies suffer a -1 penalty to this save for every 3 levels the bard possesses beyond 8th level (maximum -4 at 20th level).  The duration of this ability is extended by 1 round for every 4 levels the bard possesses beyond 8th level (maximum 4 rounds at 20th level).

### Blade Kit

BLADE: The Blade is an expert fighter and adventurer whose bardic acting abilities make <PRO_HIMHER> appear more intimidating and fearsome. This Bard's fighting style is flashy and entertaining but is also lethally dangerous.

Advantages:
- At 1st level, may use the Offensive Spin and Defensive Spin abilities once per day. Gains one use each every 4 levels thereafter.
- Performs Weapon Display as <PRO_HISHER> bard song.
- Gains Mastery (+++) in two-weapon fighting at first level.  
- At 3rd level, the Blade can specialize (++) in any single bladed weapon. At 3rd level or anytime thereafter, <PRO_HESHE> can select any single bladed weapon with which <PRO_HESHE> is proficient and become specialization with that weapon.  At 9th level, or anytime thereafter, <PRO_HESHE> can specialize (++) in a second bladed weapon <PRO_HESHE> is proficient with.

Disadvantages:

– Only gains 5 lore per level.
– Does not get access to any other performances.
- Cannot make use of magical items as the true bard.
- Receives -1 spell per spell level, and so cannot begin casting spells until 2nd level.

DEFENSIVE SPIN: Defensive spin is a specialized form of parrying that lasts for 4 round, + 1 round per 4 levels <PRO_HESHE> possesses.  While performing defensive spin, the Blade gains a +1 bonus to AC against all melee weapons for every two levels <PRO_HESHE> has (minimum +1) to a maximum of +10 at level 20.  Further, any opponent that gets in melee range (4') have a 50% chance to suffer 1d6 points of slashing damage from the whirling blades.  This damage increases by 1d6 every 5 levels.  The Blade cannot attack or cast spells while using Defensive Spin.

OFFENSIVE SPIN: Offensive spin is a much more aggressive display of prowess that lasts for 4 round, + 1 round per 4 levels <PRO_HESHE> possesses.  During this time, the Blade's movement rate doubles and <PRO_HESHE> gains a +2 bonus to melee attack and damage rolls as well as an extra attack per round. Finally,<PRO_HESHE> deals an additional +1 to damage with all melee attacks for every 5 levels. Offensive Spin may not be used in conjunction with the Haste or Improved Haste spells. <PRO_HESHE> suffers a -2 penalty to AC while using offensive spin.

WEAPON DISPLAY: When performing a weapon display, the Blade performs an impressive and intimidating display with <PRO_HISHER> weapon.  All intelligent enemies within 30' of the Blade must make a save vs. wands +4 or be overcome by fear for the duration of the display.  Enemies make their save at -1 per 3 levels of the Blade.
Additionally, the display inspires allies, granting them a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls.  This bonus increases by +1 per 5 levels.

Finally, enemies that come within melee range of the blade (about 4') have a 50% chance to take 1d6 slashing damage from the whirling blades. This damage increases by 1d6 for each 5 levels.
The blade cannot move while performing the display. That is, moving ends the performance.
